# XAI_Quantitative_Analysis

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is crucial for enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence models, particularly in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and various engineering applications. However, current XAI based studies predominantly rely on qualitative evaluations, which involve subjective visual examination of model explanations. These methods are often inconsistent among evaluators and face challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness. Our study addresses these limitations by introducing a robust quantitative approach for reliable performance evaluation. In this study, we proposed a three-stage methodology to comprehensively evaluate deep learning models in terms of both their decision-making capabilities (classification performance) and their ability to select significant features for proper decision-making. To our knowledge, this is the first study to employ a purely quantitative approach for evaluating explanations generated by XAI methods. Our methodology offers a scalable, reproducible and reliable framework for the evaluation of the performance of deep learning models, making significant contributions to the field of XAI.
